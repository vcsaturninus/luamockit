Lua and C timer callback library.




## TODOs
 * write automatic C tests as well. This is particularly important so
   we can run Valgrind and easily see if there are any memory leaks of 
   siugnificance.

 * update the war-and-peace like comments at the top of `luamockit.c`.
   A sizable part of this may be outdated now.
