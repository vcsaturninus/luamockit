 * In other words, this function will only return once the sleep has 
 * been completed (assuming no errors preventing that).
 *
 * clock_nanosleep() rather than sleep() is used so that it can be mixed
 * together with signals (the older sleep() is not suitable for that) as 
 * well as to allow for much better (nanosecond) precision.
 *
 * clock_nanosleep(), unlike nanosleep(), is Linux-specific, not POSIX-mandated,
 * so this function is not portable across unices. However, it is used
 * instead of nanosleep() because it avoids time drift (possible when 
 * repeatedly restarting sleep after signal interrupts) by allowing the 
 * specification of an absolute time value rather than a relative duration.
