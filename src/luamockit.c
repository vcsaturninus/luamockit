/* ================================ *
 * ----- Struct definitions ------  *
 * ================================ */

/*
 * an event in this context is an entry in an event queue, associated
 * with (and added as a result of the expiry of a) timer (either
 * one-shot or an interval timer).
 *
 * Each event points to a `struct mockit`, which among others,
 * contains a pointer to a `struct luamockit`. This in turn has pointers
 * to a Lua callback, the Lua state, and various references in the Lua
 * Registry used for anchoring purposes. Dequeing and 'handling' the event
 * means removing it from the event queue and calling its callback function.
 *
 * When an interval timer is disarmed, a mark is implicitly set (MOCKIT_MFD)
 * in the struct representing the timer object. The thread in charge of the
 * timer will set another mark (MOCKIT_MOD) in acknowledgement. Any event
 * struct marked with MOCKIT_MFD is ignored: the associated Lua callback is
 * NOT called anymore because the timer has been _disarmed_. However the
 * resources associated with the timer cannot be released yet either: the timer
 * _cannot_ self-destruct and clean up because there may be events in the queue
 * holding references to those resources and therefore it's a distinct possibility
 * use-after-free will be performed by the event queue processor, potentially leading
 * to a crash. Conversely, a timer cannot be destroyed from the queue event processor
 * at any given time because then the thread itself that's in charge of the  timer
 * may perform use-after-free and/or generate new events that will need to be handled
 * (and handling would be impossible since the Lua references etc will've been released
 * by the event queue processor, as mentioned).
 *
 * The sensible and correct way of releasing the resources requires coordination.
 * This is achieved through the 'marks' aforementioned. When the user wants to
 * destroy a timer, first the timer gets 'disarmed', which implicitly sets the
 * MOCKIT_MFD mark. The timer thread wil see this as soon as it wakes up and set
 * MOCKIT_MOD in acknowledgement, then generate a last MOCKIT_MOD-marked event before
 * definitely exitting. The event queue processor knows an event is essentially expired
 * when it seen the MOCKIT_MFD mark set, so the event is accordinly ignored. The next
 * event associated with the timer must be MOCKIT_MOD-marked, on receipt of which the
 * event queue processor releases all resources (e.g. any dynamic memory _not_ owned by
 * Lua, lua references etc) associated with the timer. At this point the timer is
 * considered destroyed, so we can finally return to Lua (which has been blocking on
 * the destroy call) safely.
 *
 * Interval timers are therefore a stream made up of any number of unamarked
 * events terminated with MOCKIT_MOD-marked event preceded by a MOCKIT_MFD-marked
 * event. A one-shot timer otoh always generates a single MOCKIT_MOD-marked event.
 * MOCKIT_MFD is never set for one-off timers because they never get disarmed.
 *
 * Note each event container/struct MUST have a copy of the mark of the timer AS 
 * IT WAS AT THE TIME THE EVENT WAS GENERATED. This allows each event struct to be
 * marked and examined independently as each would have its own copy of the mark.
 * Conversely, it's perilous to use the timer mark only ince if changed at any point
 * in time, since the timer object is being pointed to by every event struct, its 
 * mark will be changed even in event structs that have already been generated.
 * For example, setting MOCKIT_MOD would cause the fatal problem of multiple event
 * structs now pointing to a timer object whose mark has MOD set. Having each event
 * struct maintain its own copy of the mark avoids such thorny issues.

 * Create an interval timer that calls callback on interval expiration.

 * global event queue (`equeue`) which gets processed (ideally
 * as often as possible to ensure greater time precision) periodically
 * by lua_process_events (called from within lua), which dequeues and
 * handles every event in the queue until it's empty.
 * Each event added represents a callback that needs to be called back,
 * registered from within a lua script by passing it as the 2nd param
 * to this function.
 *
 * The result of this function, in Lua, is a `struct mockit` full userdata.
 * This MUST be assigned to a variable, in that it identifies the
 * associated interval timer created, which needs to be called
 * destroy() on when no longer needed / when the user wants to disable
 * it.
 *
 * Therefore this function must be called like this for instance:
 *    local timer_obj = luamockit.<this_function>(5,mycallback)
 * and then, when timer_obj is no longer needed:
 *    timer_obj = timer_obj:destroy() // see the timer_destroy() function below
 *
 *
 * The lua thread from within which this function got called is saved and the
 * asssociated event (timer expiration) will call back into lua using this same
 * thread (NOTE: lua thread != POSIX thread);
 * The thread/state is anchored in the registry to ensure it doesn't disappear
 * (it does not get garbage-collected).
 * However, since correct usage of this library normally consists of an infinite
 * loop (see "Lua script Design") mostly sleeping and periodically calling
 * lua_process_events() or spending most of its time waiting on semaphore signalling
 * in lua_process_events(), it's NOT expected that multiple Lua threads will be used.
 * Although this library will, as mentioned, use the Lua thread it was called from,
 * correct behavior is not guaranteed if multiple threads are in actuality used.
 *
 * --> interval @lua
 *     interval value in milliseconds to wait before calling the registered callback.

 * destroy() on.
 *
 * For interval timer objects, the result of this function MUST be

 * a userdata, which means its memory is handled by lua, and it can't

 * userdata / timer object. Therefore the user MUST NOT have multiple
 * variables pointing to the same object. Each call to
 * lua_get_interval_timer() MUST be assigned to a single unique variable
 * in lua that destroy() is then called on and its return value assigned
 * back to. Otherwise the user must make sure all references (Lua variables
 * pointing to said interval timer object / userdata) are set to nil when
